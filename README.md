### BIG O

## What is a good code?

- Readable
- Scalable

**BIG O:** Is used to determine how long and algorithm takes to run/execute.

## Big Os

1. O(1) Constant- no loops
2. O(log N) Logarithmic- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search)
3. O(n) Linear- for loops, while loops through n items
4. O(n log(n)) Log Liniear- usually sorting operations
5. O(n^2) Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two
   nested loops
6. O(2^n) Exponential- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N
7. O(n!) Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element

   **Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)**

   **Two separate collections: O(a\*b)**

## What can cause time in a function?

1.  Operations (+, -, \*, /)
2.  Comparisons (<, >, ==)
3.  Looping (for, while)
4.  Outside Function call (function())

## Rule Book

1.  Rule 1: Always worst Case
2.  Rule 2: Remove Constants
3.  Rule 3: Different inputs should have different variables. O(a+b). A and B arrays nested would be
    O(a\*b)

    \- for steps in order

    \* for nested steps

4.  Rule 4: Drop Non-dominant terms

## What causes Space complexity?-

1. Variables
2. Data Structures
3. Function Call
4. Allocations

**RUN TIME?** - Simply how long a function/task takes to run.
