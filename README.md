| 1.-     | [Big O Notation](./01-Big-O-Notation)                     | The `Array` is the most common data structure in computer programming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2.-     | [Array](./02-Array)                                       | The `Array` is the most common data structure in computer programming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3.-     | [Hash Table](./03-Hash-Table)                             | A `List` is an ordered sequence of data, where elements are not meant to be ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 4.-     | [Linked List](./04-Linked-List)                           | A `Stack` is an example of Last-in, First-Out (LIFO)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5.-     | [Stack](./05-Stack)                                       | A `Queue` is an example of First-in, First-Out (FIFO)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 6.-     | [Queue](./06-Queue)                                       | A `Linked list` is a collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a successor node in the list using an object reference.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 7.-     | [Tree](./07-Tree)                                         | Traversing a `Double linked list` are more efficient, since we no longer have to search for the previous node.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 8.-     | [Graph](./08-Graph)                                       | The reason you might want to create a `Circular linked list` is if you want the ability to go backward through a list but donâ€™t want the extra overhead of creating a doubly linked list.                                                                                                                    |
| 9.-     | [Recursion](./09-Recursion)                               | `Hashing` is a common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be inserted and retrieved very quickly. Hashing uses a data structure called a hash table. Although hash tables provide fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval, they perform poorly for operations that involve searching. |
| 10.-    | [Sorting](./10-Sorting)                                   | `Binary trees` are chosen over other more primary data structures because you can search a binary tree very quickly (as opposed to a linked list, for example) and you can quickly insert and delete data from a binary tree (as opposed to an array).                                                       |
| 11.-    | [Searching](./11-Searching)                               | A graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges. A map is a type of graph where each town is a vertex, and a road that connects two towns is an edge. Edges are defined as a pair (v1, v2), where v1 and v2 are two vertices in a graph                                                             |
| 11.-    | [Sorting Algorithms](./12-chapter-Sorting-Algorithms)     | Two of the most common operations performed on data stored in a computer are sorting and searching.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 12.-    | [Searching Algorithms](./13-chapter-Searching-Algorithms) | There are two ways to search for data in a list: sequential search and binary search. A sequential search is used when the items in a list are in random order; a binary search is used when the items in a list are in sorted order.                                                                        |
